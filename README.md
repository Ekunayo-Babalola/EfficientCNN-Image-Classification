# EfficientCNN-Image-Classification
EfficientCNN: A high-performance Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model meticulously designed for efficient image classification, achieving remarkable accuracy with minimal parameters

This model uses EfficentNet B0 as its backbone model. A small sized CNN model is attached to further extract more features. The whole model uses very few parameters to perform classification.
